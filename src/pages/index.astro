                Better understand your weight in relation to your height using
                our body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole
                determinant of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting
                point to evaluate your overall health and well-being.

            <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
            <p>
                A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
                Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of
                experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2
                diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar
                content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables.
                Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally
                about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

                <h3>Healthy eating</h3>
                <p>
                    Healthy eating promotes weight control, disease prevention,
                    better digestion, immunity, mental clarity, and mood.

                <h3>Regular exercise</h3>
                <p>
                    Exercise improves fitness, aids weight control, elevates
                    mood, and reduces disease risk, fostering wellness and
                    longevity.

                <h3>Adequate sleep</h3>
                <p>
                    Sleep enhances mental clarity, emotional stability, and
                    physical wellness, promoting overall restoration and
                    rejuvenation.

            <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
            <p>
                Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight,
                it is not suited for every person. Specific groups should
                carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the
                measurement may not be beneficial to use.
            </p>
            <div>
                <img src={genderIcon} alt="" />
                <h3>Gender</h3>
                <p>
                    The development and body fat composition of girls and boys
                    vary with age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are
                    considered when evaluating their BMI.

            <div>
                <img src={ageIcon} alt="" />
                <h3>Age</h3>
                <p>
                    In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may
                    cause BMI to underestimate body fat content.

            <div>
                <img src={muscleIcon} alt="" />
                <h3>Muscle</h3>
                <p>
                    BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or
                    obese, as it doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.

            <div>

                <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
                <p>
                    Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their
                    growing baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is
                    advisable to minimise health risks for both mother and
                    child.

                    Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black
                    and Asian origins at lower BMIs than others. To learn more,
                    it is advised to discuss this with your GP or practice
                    nurse.
